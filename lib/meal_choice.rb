# Your code here
# For output purposes, use "puts" instead of "print" or "p"

def meal_choice(veg1, veg2, protein="tofu")
  puts "What a nutritious meal!"
  puts "A plate of #{protein} with #{veg1} and #{veg2}."
  return "A plate of #{protein} with #{veg1} and #{veg2}."
end

#Why won't the test allow me to use the p method instead of the puts method and the last line?? The p method can accomplish both in one line, right?
